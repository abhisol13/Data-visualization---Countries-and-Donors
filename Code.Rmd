## using organdata, create a table of summary statistics by country called by_country (show the mean of donors, gdp, health, roads, cerebvas, and the standard deviation of donors)
by_country <- organdata %>% group_by(consent_law, country) %>% summarize_if(is.numeric, funs(mean, sd), na.rm = TRUE) %>% ungroup()

by_country <- organdata %>% group_by(consent_law, country) %>% summarize(donors_mean= mean(donors, na.rm = TRUE), donors_sd = sd(donors, na.rm = TRUE), gdp_mean = mean(gdp, na.rm = TRUE), health_mean = mean(health, na.rm = TRUE), roads_mean = mean(roads, na.rm = TRUE), cerebvas_mean = mean(cerebvas, na.rm = TRUE))
by_country

## Producing a scatterplot of the by_country data with the points colored by consent_law
p <- ggplot(data = by_country, mapping = aes(x = donors_mean, y = reorder(country, donors_mean), color = consent_law)) 
p + geom_point(size=3) + labs(x = "Donor Procurement Rate", y = "", color = "Consent Law") + theme(legend.position="top")

##Using facet_wrap() split the consent_law variable into two panels and rank the countries by donation rate within the panels.

p2 <-  ggplot(data = by_country, mapping = aes(x = donors_mean, y = reorder(country, donors_mean))) 

p2 + geom_point(size=3) + facet_wrap(~ consent_law, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1) + labs(x= "Donor Procurement Rate", y= "")


## Using geom_pointrange() to create a dot and whisker plot showing the mean of donors and a confidence interval.

p3 <- ggplot(data = by_country, mapping = aes(x = reorder(country, donors_mean), y = donors_mean)) 
p3 + geom_pointrange(mapping = aes(ymin = donors_mean - donors_sd, ymax = donors_mean + donors_sd)) + labs(x= "", y= "Donor Procurement Rate") + coord_flip()

##Creating a scatterplot of roads_mean v. donors_mean with the labels identifying the country sitting to the right or left of the point.

p4 <- ggplot(data = by_country, mapping = aes(x = roads_mean, y = donors_mean)) 
p4 + geom_point() + geom_text(mapping = aes(label = country))

p5 <- ggplot(data = by_country, mapping = aes(x = roads_mean, y = donors_mean)) 
p5 + geom_point() + geom_text(mapping = aes(label = country), hjust = 0)

## What is the electoral college?
## The Electoral College is widely known as "Winner take all” system because the winner of the popular vote in each state gets all of the state’s electoral votes.

## creating a new binary value column in organdata called 'ind' populated by determining whether the ccode is "Spa" or "Ita" and the year is after than 1998.

organdata$ind <- organdata$ccode %in% c("Ita", "Spa") & 
  organdata$year > 1998 

p7 <- ggplot(data = organdata, 
            mapping = aes(x = roads, 
                          y = donors, color = ind)) 
p7 + geom_point() + 
  geom_text_repel(data = subset(organdata, ind), 
                  mapping = aes(label = ccode)) + 
  guides(label = FALSE, color = FALSE)

 
## creating an organdata plot of Roads v. Donors and map the ind attribute to the color aesthetic. 
## Label those points with the ccode and suppress the legends.

p8 <- ggplot(data = organdata, mapping = aes(x = roads, y = donors)) 
p8 + geom_point() + 
  annotate(geom = "rect", xmin = 125, xmax = 155, ymin = 30, ymax = 35, fill = "red", alpha = 0.2) + 
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 157, y = 33, label = "Spa = Spain & Ita = Italy ", hjust = 0) + 
  guides(label = FALSE, color = FALSE) ## 10. Added a label in a rectangle to the previous plot that says 
"Spa = Spain & Ita = Italy"
```
